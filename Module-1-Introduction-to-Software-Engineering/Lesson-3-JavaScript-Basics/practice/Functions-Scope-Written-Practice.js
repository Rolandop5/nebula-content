// Answer the following questions in your own words
// 1. What is a function?
a function is a block of reusable code that performs a task within a programm.a
    
// 2. Why is it useful?

It can be reuse on other blocks of the program.
        
// 3. Give a 'real world example'. Ours was wood chipper. Try and think of something yourself. 
Recipe for Lemonade: This is like a function. You have a set of steps (mix water, lemon juice, and sugar)
 that you follow every time you make lemonade. 
Instead of explaining those steps each time, you just say "make lemonade" and everyone knows what to do.
        
// 4. There is different syntax / ways of defining a function write out the syntax for each:
// // A. Function declaration:

here is my example of a function declaration (old way)
function functionName(parameters) {
    return value
}

// // B. Function expressions:

function expression is another way to define functions needs to be expresed by initializing it with a variable and giving the variable the value of the function.
 
// // C. Arrow functions: 

is the new format to declare a function, is declare with the simbol (=>)

// 5. What is a parameter?
is basically a variable that is part of the function declaration, needs to be within parentesis

// 6. What is an argument?
is the actual value that is passed to the function to operate on a parameter.
  
// 7. What does the return statement do?

statement is used to specify the value that a function should return 
    
// 8. What is scope? Do you have a real-world example of something similar to scope?
scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a program. It defines where in the code a particular variable can be accessed or modified.
