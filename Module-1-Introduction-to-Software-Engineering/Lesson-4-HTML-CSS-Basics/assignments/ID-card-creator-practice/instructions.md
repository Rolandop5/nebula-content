## The goal is to have someone to fill in their ID card info

### Create a folder with an index.html, styles.css & script.js
- Hook up the files together - how do we test they are working?

### A user must be able to input their Name, id number, address & a fun fact about themselves
- After clicking an update button their id card will update
- Style a div to look like an ID card - curved corners, an image (start with a  placeholder image)
